# Reddit Send Message to Discord when called on Reddit

This script watches a specific subreddit for it to be called, and when it is, it sends the link to a discord channel via a webhook.

# Requirements
```
pip3 install requests
pip3 install praw
```

# How to use

## Setting up the discord webhook

* First you will navigate to the channel where you want the messages sent to, and then hover over the channel name and click the settings icon

* When you click "New Webhook" you will be prompted to enter a name for the Web Hook, and the channel that you want the messages to be posted in. Select the appropriate options for your server setup. After you have set a name, and channel click the "Copy Webhook URL" Button and then insert that URL in the ```conf.ini``` file at the option ```discord_webhook``` on line 9. 

# Final Setup

1. Generate a client secret and id at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps, and copy those into the ```conf.ini``` file on lines 4 and 5
2. Enter your Reddit Account username and password onto ```conf.ini``` lines 2 and 3
3. Set your target subreddit on line 7,
4. Set the name you want your bot to watch for on line 8 (for example set u/yourbotname if you want users to call u/yourbotname)
5. Enter the discord webhook url if you haven't already
6. Enter the name you want your discord bot to display whe it posts the message in the channel. 

After that is done, you just run it like a standard reddit bot ```python3 main.py``` or read the stickied post at the top of the subreddit for instructions on how to run on other operating systems.
